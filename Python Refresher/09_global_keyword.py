'''
The global Keyword
Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function.

To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.
'''

# If you use the global keyword, the variable belongs to the global scope:

def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)

# To change the value of a global variable inside a function, refer to the variable by using the global keyword:
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"

myfunc()    # Note: we must call this function for the change to happen. Else the global x is never called.

print("Python is " + x)
