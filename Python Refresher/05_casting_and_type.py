If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
'''


x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

'''
Get the Type
You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
'''
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
